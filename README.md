# Spotify History
This repository is for the analysis of Spotify streaming history files obtained from the Spotify website.


## Set-Up
1. Install Python (version 3)

2. Install the pipenv package with ```pip install pipenv```

3. Download your Spotify streaming data to the ```data/MyData/``` subdirectory

_To download your data, you must request the data from the [Spotify Account Privacy](https://www.spotify.com/uk/account/privacy/) page. You will then be sent a link to download the data. Note that this step can take a few days._

4. Obtain Spotify developer authorisation and store keys in ```data/api_keys/api_dev_keys.txt```

_Authorisation can be obtained by following [the steps listed on the Spotify website](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/). Your two keys should be stored on separate lines within your text file._
